    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Piccata is an Italian word spelled sometimes as picatta or pichotta. The culinary use of the Italian term means "to be pounded flat". When used 
        in reference to a way of preparing food, particularly meat or fish, it means "sliced, sautéed, and served in a sauce containing lemon, 
        butter and spices". Traditionally, the Italians use veal (veal piccata); however, the best known dish of this sort in the US uses chicken 
        (chicken piccata). The recipe has a meatless adaptation using seitan (seitan piccata). Piccata is also prepared using veal (piccata di vitello 
        al limone) or frittura piccata,[1] particularly in the Milanese region swordfish (pesce spada con capperi e limone).

    <p>
        A chicken breast is butterflied or sliced along its width. It is flattened to an even thickness with a tenderizer between two pieces 
        of wax paper or plastic wrap. It is seasoned and dredged in flour before being browned in butter or olive oil. The sauce is made using 
        the pan drippings. Lemon juice and white wine or chicken stock are added and reduced. Shallots or garlic can be added with capers, chopped 
        parsley and slices of lemon. After reduction, butter is stirred in to finish the sauce. In the United States, it is usually served 
        with a vegetable or a starch, such as pasta, polenta, or rice. In Italy, veal piccata is a secondo and would be served after the pasta 
        (or other starch) course.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour
            and shake off any excess.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, 
            and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook 
            until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a 
            thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
        </li>
    </ol>
