    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Salmon is a common food fish classified as an oily fish[1] with a rich content of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.
        In Norway – a major producer of farmed and wild salmon – farmed and wild salmon differ only slightly in terms of food 
        quality and safety, with farmed salmon having lower content of environmental contaminants, and wild salmon having higher 
        content of omega-3 fatty acids.

        The maple glaze in this dish really brings out the salmon flavors. It is very to prepare and very delicious.
